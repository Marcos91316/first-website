    <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/argentinian-beef-empanadas" target="_blank"><img src="empanadas.jpg" alt="picture of empanadas" width="200"></a>
    <p>What makes an argentinean empanada different from other countries is that the dough is flour based instead of corn. They can be filled with beef, chicken, ham and cheese, sweet corn or swiss chard and cheese before being sealed or turned over.</p>

    <p>An asado is meat grilled to its purest form, traditionally the fire used to cook the meat is made with a combination of red-hot coal and firewood, though the exact type of wood may vary from region to region.</p>
